RISC V Enthusiast

- Hi, I’m @mamuneeb. I am pre-final year Undergraduate Student pursuing B.E. in ECE from GNDEC, Bidar. I’m interested in Computer Architecture, RISC V, Digital Electronics, RTL Design and FPGA Prototyping. I had designed a simple and basic RISC V Core. I’m currently working on Design of pipelined RISC V Cores using Verilog. I’m Research Enthusiast and want to pursue career in Hardware Design specialized in RISC V. I had already published a Research Paper entitled "A Complete Survey of RISC V Architecture" in International Conference. I am open for collaborations regarding RISC V Based projects, Research Papers etc.
