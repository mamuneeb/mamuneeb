I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from GNDECB. My passion for semiconductors ignited during my second year, and I am proficient in C, Assembly Language, Verilog HDL, and EDA tools like Xilinx Vivado and Intel Quartus Prime. I also have experience with various software and technologies, including VS Code, MATLAB, and GitHub, and I'm comfortable with both Windows and Linux operating systems.

I've authored three research papers, including one on softprocessor RISCV-EC, published in the Springer Series, and another on a Physically Unclonable Function Architecture in a Scopus-indexed journal. I served as the Student Chair of IEEE SB & IEEE CASS SC GNDECB, leading our chapter to win an award in 2021-2022. My interests lie in Computer Architecture, Digital Design, FPGAs, Heterogeneous Computing, Front-end VLSI Design, and Processor Design. I'm open to collaborations and can be reached at mamuneeb@ieee.org or +91 7019066354. Feel free to connect with me.
